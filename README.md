#### FAQ (not really)
**Q:** Do your ISO's have those stupid looking cracked themes that looks absolutely horrendous? <br />
**A:** Nope, I don't change anything on the UI except for StartIsBack, since Windows Search and Cortana is disabled.

**Q:** Do I have to format everything? <br />
**A:** Yes! So if you have any important files, PLEASE back them up.

**Q:** What ISO do you think is the best for performance? <br />
**A:** Windows 10 LTSB, since it's balanced (being Windows 10 while having the performance of Windows 7 Lite)

**Q:** What features are removed from these ISO's? <br />
**A:** Your ISO and removed features will be in a zip file, the zip file includes: <br />
* FeaturesRemoved.txt <br />
